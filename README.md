# Git Commands Practice

This repository is a **practice project** where I tested and learned various Git commands to understand version control basics.

## üìå Purpose
The goal of this repo is to:
- Learn how to initialize a Git repository
- Practice staging and committing changes
- Push code to a remote repository
- Get comfortable with the Git workflow

## üõ†Ô∏è Commands Practiced
Here are the key Git commands I tested:

```bash
# Initialize a new Git repository
git init

# Check repository status
git status

# Stage all changes
git add .

# Commit changes with a message
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# Add remote repository (example: GitHub)
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repo.git

# Push commits to the remote repository
git push -u origin main
